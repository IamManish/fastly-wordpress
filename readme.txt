Integrates Fastly with WordPress publishing tools.

This is the official Fastly plugin for WordPress.

The official code repository for this plugin is available here:

https://github.com/fastly/WordPress-Plugin/

== Description ==
Usage:

- Pulls in the [Fastly API](http://docs.fastly.com/api)
- Integrates purging in post/page/taxonomies publishing
- Includes an admin panel in `wp-admin`
- Integrates some of the advanced purging options from Fastly API
- Allows to monitor purging using webhooks for slack

Using this plugin means you won\'t have to purge content in Fastly when you make changes to your WordPress content. Purges will automatically happen with no need for manual intervention.

Customization:

Available wordpress hooks (add_action) on:

Editing purging keys output
 purgely_pre_send_keys
 purgely_post_send_keys
    functions: add_keys

Editing surrogate control headers output(max-age, stale-while-revalidate, stale-if-error)
 purgely_pre_send_surrogate_control
 purgely_post_send_surrogate_control
    functions: edit_headers, unset_headers

Edit cache control headers output (max-age)
 purgely_pre_send_cache_control
 purgely_post_send_cache_control
    functions: edit_headers, unset_headers

Example:
add_action(\'purgely_pre_send_surrogate_control\', \'custom_headers_edit\');
function custom_headers_edit($header_object)
{
  $header_object->edit_headers(array(\'custom-header\' => \'555\', \'max-age\' => \'99\'));
}

== Installation ==
You can either install from source (you\'re looking at it), or from the WordPress [plugin directory](http://wordpress.org/plugins/fastly/).

0. Register on `https://www.fastly.com/signup`
1. Register new Service with your domain and obtain API token and Service ID
2. Deploy the new Version of the Service.
3. In your Wordpress blog admin panel, Under Fastly->General, enter & save your Fastly API token and Service ID
4. Verify connection by pressing `TEST CONNECTION` button.
5. If connection is ok, press `Update VCL` button
6. That\'s it! Everything should just work. :metal: If you have any problems, email us.

Note: you may have to disable other caching plugins like W3TotalCache to avoid getting odd cache behaviour.
