Integrates Fastly with WordPress' publishing tools.

== Description ==

Take a look at the inline comments in the [code](https://github.com/fastly/WordPress-Plugin/tree/master/lib) for an in depth description. But, the plugin:

- Pulls in the [Fastly API](http://docs.fastly.com/api)
- Wires Instant Purging into the publishing process, keeping content up to date
- Includes an admin panel in `wp-admin`

Using this plugin means you won't have to purge content in Fastly when you make changes to your WordPress content. Purges will automatically happen with no need for manual intervention.

== Installation ==

You can either install from source (you're looking at it), or from the WordPress [plugin directory](http://wordpress.org/plugins/fastly/).

1. To proceed with configuration you will need to sign up for Fastly (at fastly.com/signup) and create and activate a new service. Details of how to create and activate a new service can be found at Fastly's documentation. You will also need to find your Service ID and make a note of the string. 
2. From Fastly's configuration interface, crete an API token with the default scope and access level. Make a note of the credential. 
3. Set up the Fastly plugin inside your WordPress admin panel
4. Once the plugin is installed into your WordPress instance, you will need to enter your API token and Service ID into the plugin's configuration page. 
5. That's it! Everything should just work. In order to route production traffic through Fastly, you will likely need to change some records with your domain registrar. Refer to Fastly's documentation for more instructions about which CNAME records to use. 
6. In order to get the most value out of Fastly, you should create a VCL Snippet on your Fastly service which allows you to define some custom logic for how the Fastly CDN should handle requests to your WordPress instance. For more information, or if you have any problems, please email us.

_Note: you may have to disable other caching plugins like W3TotalCache to avoid getting odd cache behaviour._

_Note: you can enable "soft" purging for urls. You can read more about soft purging [here](https://www.fastly.com/blog/introducing-soft-purge-more-efficient-way-mark-outdated-content) and [here](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/purging/soft-purges)._

== Prequisites ==

The server must have "php5-curl" installed on the server you are hosting Wordpress with e.g

  `sudo apt-get install php5-curl`

== Customization ==

If you need to edit/add/remove headers (for now only Surrogate-Control) outputed by the plugin, it can be done by hooking with wordpress add_action on tag "purgely_post_send_surrogate_control"
and "purgely_post_send_surrogate_control", and calling on object "unset_headers" function for removing headers, or "edit_headers" function for rewriting or adding new headers.

Example (add this to your theme function.php) :

add_action('purgely_pre_send_surrogate_control', 'custom_headers_edit');
function custom_headers_edit($header_object)
{
  $header_object->edit_headers(array('custom-header' => '555', 'max-age' => '99'));
}
